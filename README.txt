I built an oscilloscope using microcontrollers and potentiometers as the final project for a microprocessor class (CMPE 121L) in UC Santa Cruz. The microcontrollers used were the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and PSoC5. They were connected with USB protocol to transfer signal data and create the interface, and I2C protocol to control and manipulate the signal. The oscilloscope was built with the 2 connected microcontrollers on a prototyping breadboard.
